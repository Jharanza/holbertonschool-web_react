<h1>Typescript</h1>
<p>In this project, we learn about Typescript, and we use node -v 20 with npm -v 10 and as code editor we use Visual studio code. The dependencys are the newest to prevent errors</p>
<p>We use node -v 20.x.x because when we used -v < 20 we have errors when we ran npm run build</p>
